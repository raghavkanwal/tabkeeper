<h1>Hello</h1><br/>
<p>Hi! Welcome to my college project. I'm Raghav Kanwal (Enrollment Number 03017702011), and this is my Ruby on Rails application which I call 'TabKeeper'. This app can be used to keep a well documented record of some Bills and/or Dues that you might be running into, so that you can keep a track of them and not worry about forgetting something important.</p><br/>
<p>I've made this application using Ruby on Rails, which is an open web-framework used to make full-fledged web applications. This allows my project to be completely hosted on the internet. That, in-turn, means that the user need not "install" the app on a single device. This will be available to the user no matter which device he uses, whether it be a smartphone in a hurry, a tablet while relaxing, or a Desktop/Notebook while working.</p>
